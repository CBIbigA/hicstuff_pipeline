A Snakemake workflow for `<description>`


## Usage

The usage of this workflow is described in the [Snakemake Workflow Catalog](https://snakemake.github.io/snakemake-workflow-catalog/?usage=CBIbigA%2Fhicstuff_pipeline).

If you use this workflow in a paper, don't forget to give credits to the authors by citing the URL of this (original) hicstuff_pipelinesitory and its DOI (see above).

# TODO

* Replace `CBIbigA` and `hicstuff_pipeline` everywhere in the template (also under .github/workflows) with the correct `hicstuff_pipeline` name and owning user or organization.
* Replace `<name>` with the workflow name (can be the same as `hicstuff_pipeline`).
* Replace `<description>` with a description of what the workflow does.
* The workflow will occur in the snakemake-workflow-catalog once it has been made public. Then the link under "Usage" will point to the usage instructions if `CBIbigA` and `hicstuff_pipeline` were correctly set.
